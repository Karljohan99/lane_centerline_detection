# Lane Centerline Detection from Orthophotos using Transformer Networks

Code for training a lane detection model with RNGDet [1] and RNGDet++ [2] deep learning networks.

Detection results of Tartu, Estonia can be found in the `results` directory.

This project uses code from the following open-sourced projects:
* [RNGDetPlusPlus](https://github.com/TonyXuQAQ/RNGDetPlusPlus)
* [Sat2Graph](https://github.com/songtaohe/Sat2Graph)
* [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr)
